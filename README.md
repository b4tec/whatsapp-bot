It is not possible to integrate OpenAI chat bot directly with WhatsApp account as WhatsApp does not provide a public API for chatbots. However, there are third-party services that allow you to create a chatbot and integrate it with WhatsApp account.

One such service is Twilio, which provides an API for WhatsApp messaging. To integrate OpenAI chat bot with Twilio, you can use the following Python script: `bot.py`

In this script, we first set up the OpenAI API key and model engine. Then, we define a function `generate_response` that takes in user text and generates a response using OpenAI. 

Next, we set up the Twilio account details and define a function `handle_message` to handle incoming WhatsApp messages. This function generates a response using `generate_response` and sends it back to the user.

Finally, we set up a Twilio webhook using Flask to listen for incoming messages and call `handle_message` to handle them. When a user sends a message to your WhatsApp account, Twilio will send a webhook to your server, which will generate a response using OpenAI and send it back to the user.

Note that you will need to set up a webhook URL in your Twilio account and configure your WhatsApp account to use it. You will also need to have a publicly accessible server to host this script.
